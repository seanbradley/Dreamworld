#SIMPLETOWN
####a lightweight Django app fetching JSON data from an external API




###ABOUT SIMPLETOWN
Set up camp on AWS with Django in five minutes or less...

You can see a live example of the site at:

If you want a smart barebones project skeleton for your first or your next Django project, especially with **Heroku** in mind, then checkout [django-skel] (https://github.com/rdegges/django-skel) and/or [django-twoscoops-project] (https://github.com/seanbradley/django-twoscoops-project).

If, however, you are new to Django, and/or new to deploying Python frameworks on **AWS**, then you may need a little more meat on dem bones to get started.  If so, Simpletown is for you. Simpletown not only clearly hints at best practices, but provides everything you need to launch a complete--albeit minimal and easy to wrangle--Django project on one of Amazon's EC2 instances.  Simpletown comes not only with a few nicities for deploying on AWS, but also with two example views--easy-to-understand functional views--one of which fetches resources from an external API.

The project evolved out of a couple very similar technical interview.  The challenge: code from scratch a Django driven site with the some given view requisite. Develop, integrate version control, and then deploy the whole thing on an AWS Linux instance.  It seems to be a not so uncommon technical interview request.  Plus: the usual expectation is to do this within 24-hours.

I'd rather do it in 5 minutes.

_Voila'._  I give you Simpletown.

Simpletown presently has a couple different example views.

_List Cities_ retrieves US Geographic Survey data dynamically from the Small Business Admnistration's (SBA) API by using Kenneth Reitz's excellent [Requests] (http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library, and then cleans up the JSON and displays it as a list.

_Search Cities_ displays city info for a given county by querying a PostgreSQL database, which is manually populated with city info via a JSON fixture--the fixture itself being created from the the same SBA API.

_Search Cars_ is similar to Search Cites insomuch as it displays vehicle make and model by a fictitious VSN (Vehicle Serial Number)--i.e., a made-up identifier analogous to a VIN, or Vehicle Identification Number.  Also similar to the Search Cities app, the Search Cars app queries the PostgreSQL database, which is likewise populated via a fixture.  However, the app assumes the raw data is supplied in CSV format, and some utilities are provided for converting the data to JSON.  Moreover, the data for the cars app contains some wildcard characters.


###TECHNOLOGY STACK
There are many ways to deploy Django.  Simpletown uses: Django, mod_wsgi, and Apache installed on an AWS EC2 server (Ubuntu Precise 12.04-i386) associated with an Elastic IP. PostgreSQL is the database used in both development and production.  Site styling provided courtesy of Bootstrap.  All HTML5/CSS3 is fully validated.


###"FAST LANE" AMI FOR A RAPID LAUNCH (COMING SOON!)
Your own copy of Simpletown is available and instantly deployable in _less than_ five minutes if you purchase its Amazon Machine Image (AMI)...which is available for a one-time fee of just $5.  Save yourself the headache of backwards engineering the site from this repo; fahgeddabout configuring Apache and mod_wsgi. For the price of your carmel mocha machiatto (or a Redbull and Top Ramen), you can get past the boring Advil-laden part of deployment, and jump right into writing new models, new views, and styling your Django app as you see fit. Everything but e-mail settings are automagically configured for you in the FAST LANE AMI.


###SETTINGS
With regard to Django settings, check out _The One True Way_ by Jacob Kaplan Moss:
<https://speakerdeck.com/jacobian/the-best-and-worst-of-django?slide=81>

Code is opinionated.  Here's an alternative to the above by Bruno Renié:
<http://bruno.im/2013/may/18/django-stop-writing-settings-files/>

Simpletown's settings live in the _settings_ directory with separate files providing settings common to all environments ( _base.py_ ), as well as files providing settings unique to development ( _dev.py_ ), and production ( _prod.py_ ) environments.  Most settings are handled in this manner in accord with Kaplan Moss' "One True Way", but some are managed via environment variables and/or envdir in the manner prescribed by Renié.  Whenever possible, environment variables are set dynamically, outside of the settings.py.  Simpletown's settings are still being optimized with the intent of enabling the aforementioned "Fast Lane" deployment on AWS, so--in the interim--some environment variables may need to be set manually.


You will need to change the following after launch...

In your Django settings file...
* ADMINS
* EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD
* EMAIL_HOST_USER

In the .bashrc of your development machine...
* SECRET_KEY
* DEBUG

Set the SECRET_KEY and DEBUG as an environment variable on your development machine, like so...

    SECRET_KEY="your_secret_key"; export SECRET_KEY
    DEBUG="True"; export DEBUG

Or, make these settings permanent in your development environment via placing the following in ~/.bashrc, like so...

    export SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key'
    export DEBUG = 'True'

After adjusting these settings, remember to...

    touch .bashrc

If you're using a virtualenv--and you should-- _and_ you plan on running multiple environments on the same machine, you can place the above environment variable settings in your _bin/activate script_.  If you don't plan on running multiple environments on the same machine, just stick with placing the settings in the  _.bashrc_ file of your home directory.

Finally, if you use a different e-mail provider than Gmail, you'll have to provide additional e-mail info in Django's settings file.


###STATIC ASSETS VS. MEDIA FILES
As in other web frameworks,  "media" directories are traditionally reserved for files uploaded by users, and "static" is the label applied to resources related to styling the site. Django has its own conventions in this regard, and can get rather nuanced in its efforts to keep things tidy and loosely coupled between "apps" within a single overarching project.  Particularly, it's careful with regard to namespacing of static files, so that each Django app within a project can contain its own static assets (i.e., css, js, and img files) without name conflicts.  Django provides a convenience function--_collectstatic_--to gather all of these resources into a common directory (the "static" directory) and to reference them via a common URL.  (See: <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/static-files/>)

Many beginning Djangonauts find this process and its nomenclature a bit confusing.  Simpletown follows the convention of most Python and other web frameworks: it simply places all style related assets into one directory from the get go.  _Any_ file that has to do with styling of the site is labeled as "styles", and that's the directory in which you'll find it.  The "static" directory is empty--intentionally so--and should be left empty.  Manually placing files in the "static" directory will raise an ImproperlyConfigured exception. Presently, executing this command...

    ./manage.py collectstatic

...is still required to gather assets in the STYLE directory to the STATIC directory, and serve them up via the appropriate URL.

For styling related assets, Simpletown provides the following directories...

styles<br />
....site-styles<br />
........css<br />
........img<br />
........js<br />
....admin-styles<br />
........css<br />
........img<br />
........js<br />


###TODO
* the virtualenv needs to be created with the --no-site-packages flag; this wasn't done on either the development machine nor the production machine, so the requirements.txt file may be a bit out of sync with regard to dependencies, and may require tweaking.
* view_one loads slowly; page caching helps after the page loads the first time, but perhaps it'd be nicer if the data were fetched asynchronously while displaying a throbber or progress bar.
* minor performance improvements might be enabled if static files were moved to S3 and retrieved from CloudFront CDN.
